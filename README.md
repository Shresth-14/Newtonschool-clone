This CSS file is designed to style a responsive, fixed-header web interface that likely serves as a landing or dashboard page, possibly for an educational or institutional platform. The stylesheet begins with a reset of default browser margins and paddings, followed by full viewport occupation settings for the HTML and body tags, ensuring the layout spans the full screen height and width.

The layout is composed of multiple sections, with #header and #extrahead handling the fixed top bar and an additional banner space. These sections are styled to remain fixed at the top with appropriate z-indexing and borders. The logo and user profile image areas (#logo, #sj) are styled to sit neatly within the header, along with a right-aligned floating arrow navigation component (#arrow), which changes background color on hover to enhance user interaction.

Main content sections like #page1 and #page2 use flexbox to distribute child elements horizontally, suggesting a dashboard-like layout. Visual identity elements such as institutional logos (#logo2) and taglines (#ug, #ug2, #ug3, etc.) are aligned and spaced for clarity using consistent padding and typography styling.

Image containers such as #banglore, #delpune, #delhi, and #pune are structured to present multiple campus or location-based visuals, each with associated descriptive text blocks (#ug6, #ug7, etc.) for context. These sections use overflow handling and padding to maintain layout integrity across various screen sizes.

The CSS also defines modular card components like .idiot, #profile, and #jeeâ€”each representing user profile cards, status updates, or verification sections. These cards use box styling, consistent padding, typography, and image handling to present data cleanly and uniformly.

Interactive components like the #share button, the edit button (#edit), and verification prompts are given hover effects, branding colors (greens and blues), and user-friendly dimensions for better usability. Typography throughout is controlled using system fonts for high compatibility, and special attention is given to weights, spacing, and letter tracking for a professional look.

The footer (#footer) contains institutional branding and support links, styled to visually balance the page and offer accessible contact or social media pathways (#footlogo, #copyright, .support, #social).

Lastly, #campus appears to be a special element possibly used to highlight selected campuses or offer floating interactivity, positioned fixed and aligned to the right portion of the screen.
